    const prompt = `You are an expert ATS (Applicant Tracking System) data extractor.
Extract ALL resume details from the provided document with 100% completeness.
Do NOT skip, summarize, or infer any data that is not explicitly present in the document.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SECTION 1 — CONTACT ITEMS (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Scan the ENTIRE document for every URL, link, handle, email, and phone number.
Extract each one into "contactItems" as a separate object: { "label": "...", "url": "..." }.

Rules by type — follow EXACTLY:

EMAIL
  - label: "Email"
  - url: MUST start with "mailto:" → e.g., "mailto:john@example.com"

PHONE
  - label: "Phone"
  - url: MUST start with "tel:" → e.g., "tel:+886912345678"
    If no country code is present, infer from context (Taiwan → +886, US → +1, UK → +44).
    Remove spaces, dashes, and parentheses from the number.

LINKEDIN
  - label: "LinkedIn"
  - url: MUST start with "https://www.linkedin.com/in/"
    Examples of input → output:
      "linkedin.com/in/johndoe"      → "https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndoe"
      "/in/johndoe"                  → "https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndoe"
      "LinkedIn: johndoe"            → "https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndoe"

GITHUB
  - label: "GitHub"
  - url: MUST start with "https://github.com/"
    Examples of input → output:
      "github.com/johndoe"           → "https://github.com/johndoe"
      "@johndoe (GitHub)"            → "https://github.com/johndoe"
      "GitHub: johndoe"              → "https://github.com/johndoe"

TWITTER / X
  - label: "Twitter" or "X"
  - url: MUST start with "https://x.com/" or "https://twitter.com/"
    Examples of input → output:
      "@johndoe (Twitter)"           → "https://x.com/johndoe"
      "twitter.com/johndoe"          → "https://twitter.com/johndoe"

BEHANCE
  - label: "Behance"
  - url: MUST start with "https://www.behance.net/"
    Example: "behance.net/johndoe"   → "https://www.behance.net/johndoe"

DRIBBBLE
  - label: "Dribbble"
  - url: MUST start with "https://dribbble.com/"
    Example: "dribbble.com/johndoe"  → "https://dribbble.com/johndoe"

MEDIUM / SUBSTACK / BLOG
  - label: "Medium", "Substack", or "Blog"
  - url: Prepend "https://" if no protocol is present.
    Example: "medium.com/@johndoe"   → "https://medium.com/@johndoe"

PORTFOLIO / WEBSITE / OTHER URL
  - label: Use a descriptive name (e.g., "Portfolio", "Website", "Personal Site")
  - url: MUST start with "https://" — if "http://" is shown, keep as-is; if no protocol, prepend "https://"
    Example: "johndoe.com"           → "https://johndoe.com"

IMPORTANT:
  - Never output a bare domain like "linkedin.com/in/johndoe" — always include the full protocol.
  - Never set "url" to null, "", or "#" if a usable link or identifier is present.
  - If a URL appears outside the contact section (e.g., a project link, a publication link), still include it in contactItems with an appropriate label.
  - Each contactItem must be a distinct object — do not combine multiple links into one.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SECTION 2 — WORK EXPERIENCE & EDUCATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Extract ALL entries in chronological order as they appear. Do not merge, skip, or truncate any.

For each entry:
  - "title": Job title OR degree name
      Examples: "Senior Product Manager", "Software Engineer Intern",
                "Bachelor of Business Administration", "MSc in Computer Science"
  - "subtitle": Company name OR school name, including location if stated in the document
      Examples: "Google, Mountain View, CA", "National Taiwan University, Taipei",
                "McKinsey & Company", "HSBC, Hong Kong"
  - "period": Exact date range as written in the document
      Examples: "Jul 2023 – Sep 2023", "2021 – 2024", "Mar 2020 – Present"
      Use "Present" if the role is ongoing. Do NOT invent or estimate dates.
  - "description": Reproduce ALL bullet points, responsibilities, achievements, and details.
      Use "•" as the bullet character and "\n" between each item.
      Do NOT leave this empty if the source contains any content for this entry.
